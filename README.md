# Configure AWS Credential Profiles for GitHub Actions
This action uses the official `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2` action. This action only supports assuming roles via OIDC.

The official action is not sufficient for multiple account usage as it can only set one set of AWS environment variables at a time.

> The primary reason this action exists is to address using multiple profiles at the same time. Region defaults to `us-west-2`.
